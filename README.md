# New Tab Address Bar Workaround

A Firefox addon workaround for address bar focus loss when new tabs are moved to new windows.

Get the addon here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-address-bar-workaround/

## Motive

When opening a new tab, my behavior is typically to drag it to a new window (instead of opening a new window directly). When this happens, the address bar of the new tab becomes unfocused by Firefox (it appears the entire window becomes unfocused). This does not happen in Chrome. In Chrome, after dragging the new tab to its own window, the address bar is focused and ready for typing. This extension is meant to fix the flaw in Firefox.

For those of you who frequently use the Ctrl+N hotkey to open new tabs (instead of the Ctrl+T hotkey), this extension is not for you.
